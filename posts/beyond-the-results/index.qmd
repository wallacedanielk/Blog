Now that we have some preliminary results, can we do better?  We noticed that the data was imbalanced,  but what does that mean?  It means that one label appears more frequently thatn the other. How much more frequently?  Well in this case, 6 times more. There are 1233 counts of 0 and 237 counts of 1 in my numeric labels.  Using something called SMOTE, I can resample the data and make synthetic copies of the data to try to make up for the lack of samples in the minority data.  

Let us consider an absurd example. Say that there were 400,000  0's and 2 1's.  well, the random forest has a lot of samples to train on for 0's but only two for 1's and that can lead to not being able to generalize the model to pick up new 1's in the future. So, we create our own data that mimics the current data and gives the model something to train on.  This is exactly what I did.   The problem here, is that SMOTE actually did worse than just using stratified sampling alone to make sure my 70 / 30 split had samples of each type in it.  

My results for this project are being submitted as a jupyter notebook, that in the future you may be able to walkthrough and see exactly how I did what I did. 

Thank you for joining me on this little trip to finishing up my midterm project, I hope to see you again in the final!
