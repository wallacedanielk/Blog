    "text": "In the beginning there was data. Every good machine learning project starts with a question. Every question is answered by the data. So my goal is to ask interesting questions and hope that my data can answer them.\nMy first question is a simple one: I employ a diverse group of talented people, how do I know when I am about to lose one of them? Well, you could start with building relationships and just asking. However, let’s say that I employ a lot of people, and my middle managers are not exactly keeping up with the temperature at the office, so let’s see what I can answer with data.\nWhat is my data set you ask? Here is a link:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset\nI am starting with 34 features and one label (‘attrition’) that simply says yes they left, or no they stayed.\nThe dataaset has 1470 rows of data. The data is synthetic data generated by IBM, so some of the usual problems do not exist (missing data, accidental entries out of range) so, in that case my data is relatively clean. I will need to do some scaling, change some categories to numerics, and select the features that I will use. I also have some imbalance in the data that I will need to deal with.\nI am sure I am not the first person to think about this and not the first person to use this data, so I will first dig into what other people have done and if I like it or if I can find a novel approach.\nNext time, we start preprocessing!"
